Encfs uses the GNU autoconf / automake toolchain to create makefiles.

The configure script is automatically generated, but is part of most EncFS
distributions.  If you have a distribution that does not contain the configure
script, then you can generate it by running "autoreconf -if" or by running
"make -f Makefile.dist".

To build encfs, run:

./configure
make

This creates two executables, encfs and encfsctl  in the encfs directory.  You
can install to in a system directory via "make install".  If the default path
(/usr/local) is not where you want things installed, then use the "--prefix"
option to configure to specify the install prefix.

Encfs and encfsctl can also be installed by hand.  They need no special
permissions.  You may also want the man pages encfs.1 and encfsctl.1.
